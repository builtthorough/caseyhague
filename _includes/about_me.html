	I am making the “leap” into my passion career: Computer programming. 
	You’ll see 6+ years of two successful careers in law and real estate on my resume. 
	During that entire time, I spent almost every free moment learning to program because I quickly learned that I love it. 
	Now I want to work in doing what I love.
        	</p>
        	<p>
	My primary goal is to get my first job as an entry level computer programmer working with some of the best minds in this field 
	so I can learn to be the best. Although my focus is still pretty general at this early stage, I do know that I like building 
	practical programs to help people be more productive. My projects are tools I built for myself to serve that purpose. 
	Although I have bills to pay like anyone else, financial goals are secondary to my primary goal of working with those who are 
	incredibly passionate about this field, like me.
        	</p>
		<p>
	I have studied through various resources and spent countless hours to develop the computer programming skills I have now. 
	I also have been guided by a great mentor and senior software developer in the last six months regarding the practical skills of the job like using terminal commands and a version control system like git. I am a “beginner” who is still learning, but I am an ego-less, high work-ethic learner. I strongly believe I will be valuable to a company on day one.

		    <ul>
          		<li>
	<b>Built Two Fully-Functional Programs:</b> "Type R Tracker", built in Python, and "Things That Work, Things That Don't", 
	in Php and MySQL. Both are fully-functional, fast programs that work exactly as designed. I strongly believe in working through 
	all errors to deliver finished and polished products. 
			</li>
		    	<li>
	<b>Proven Success in Business Goals:</b> I excelled practicing law in California in a corporate atmosphere for 3.5 years 
	and, in the 3 years following, sold millions of dollars in gross sales in the Arizona luxury real estate market. What this means
	for my new career path is that I have already-strengthened skills in working with teams, meeting deadlines, achieving group goals,
	performing under pressure and producing with and without supervision.
			</li>
		    	<li>
	<b>Work Ethic Translatable to Programming:</b> I graduated from one of the top law schools in the country,
	passed two Bar Exams and am a licensed attorney in CA and AZ. The work ethic I applied toward those achievements,
	as well as the analytical skills built as a result thereof, has allowed me to successfully build my current 
	software programming skills through self-guided learning.
