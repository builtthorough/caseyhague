           I am making the “leap” into my passion career: Computer programming. You’ll see 6+ years of two successful careers in law and real estate on my resume. During that entire time, I spent almost every free moment learning to program because I quickly learned that I love it. Now I want to work in doing what I love.
        </p>
        <p>
          My primary goal is to get my first job as an entry level computer programmer working with some of the best minds in this field so I can learn to be the best. Although my focus is still pretty general at this early stage, I do know that I like building practical programs to help people be more productive. My projects are tools I built for myself to serve that purpose. Although I have bills to pay like anyone else, financial goals are secondary to my primary goal of working with those who are incredibly passionate about this field, like me.
        </p>

          I have studied through various resources and spent countless hours to develop the computer programming skills I have now. I also have been guided by a great mentor and senior software developer in the last six months regarding the practical skills of the job like using terminal commands and a version control system like git. I am a “beginner” who is still learning, but I am an ego-less, high work-ethic learner. I strongly believe I will be valuable to a company on day one.
